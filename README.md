# eMAN ‚Äî Your UI-Friendly eBPF Manager

**eMAN** is an intuitive, terminal-based interface for managing, exploring, and interacting with **eBPF programs**.
It takes the complexity of raw eBPF tooling and wraps it in a clean, user-friendly UI, making it easier for developers, SREs, and security engineers to understand, debug, and control eBPF workloads in real time.

---

## üìú Description

eBPF (extended Berkeley Packet Filter) is a powerful kernel technology enabling deep observability, security enforcement, and networking capabilities without modifying the kernel itself. However, most eBPF tools are CLI-heavy, fragmented, and require intricate knowledge to operate effectively.

**eMAN** bridges that gap by:

* Providing a **visual, interactive dashboard** for eBPF programs, maps, and events.
* Offering **intuitive navigation** with tables, lists, and detailed info views.
* Making **eBPF management accessible** to both experts and newcomers.

## üí° How It Can Help

* **For Observability Engineers** ‚Äî Quickly inspect running eBPF programs, view map data, and track metrics visually.
* **For Security Teams** ‚Äî Audit loaded eBPF probes and see their configuration in real time.
* **For Developers** ‚Äî Speed up debugging of eBPF-based applications without memorizing complex CLI commands.
* **For SREs** ‚Äî Monitor eBPF states in production without hopping between multiple tools.

By removing steep learning curves, **eMAN** can drastically reduce operational friction, enhance team adoption of eBPF, and improve both performance and security insights.

## üöÄ Features

* **Interactive TUI (Terminal User Interface)** powered by Rust.
* **Map list view** ‚Äî See available eBPF maps with IDs, types, and max entries.
* **Map detail view** ‚Äî Inspect map contents, configurations, and related programs.
* **Smooth navigation** ‚Äî Scrollbars, keybindings, and clean layouts for quick access.
* **Header/Footer context bars** for relevant actions and information.
* **Multi-screen support** ‚Äî Switch seamlessly between overviews and detail screens.
* **Modular UI components** ‚Äî Easy to extend and customize.
* **Efficient rendering** ‚Äî Built to handle large map lists without lag.

## üì¶ Current Development

* Map listing and detail screens are functional.
* Scrollable tables and sections for smooth data browsing.
* Modular UI architecture (`uis::header`, `uis::table`, etc.).
* Core layout system using `ratatui` for consistent rendering.
* Initial state management for navigation and selection.

## üõ£ Future Development / Roadmap

1. **Program Management**

   * Load/unload eBPF programs from the UI.
   * Attach/detach hooks dynamically.

2. **Map Editing**

   * Modify eBPF map values directly from the UI.
   * Export/import maps as JSON or binary.

3. **Metrics & Live Updates**

   * Real-time counters, histograms, and tracing.
   * Integration with perf events.

4. **Security Auditing**

   * Show program origin, permissions, and verifier logs.
   * Highlight unsigned or suspicious programs.

5. **Plugin System**

   * Extend functionality with custom modules.
   * Support for tracing, networking, and security plugins.

6. **Remote Management**

   * Manage eBPF programs across nodes via SSH or gRPC.

7. **User Profiles**

   * Save preferred layouts, filters, and viewing modes.

## üìä Impact

eBPF adoption is growing rapidly, but its ecosystem still struggles with approachability.
**eMAN** aims to:

* Shorten the learning curve for new users.
* Increase visibility of kernel-level operations.
* Empower teams to make informed decisions about eBPF usage.
* Reduce costly downtime by making debugging faster and more visual.

By making eBPF more accessible, **eMAN** helps unlock the full potential of modern observability and security without sacrificing performance.
